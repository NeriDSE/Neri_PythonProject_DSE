This is my Python project for my Data Management Python module class from my Msc in Data Science for Economics at Universit√† di Milano (UNIMI)

The purpose of the project is to create a custom algorithm to rank board games from BGG (Board Game Geeks)

The project works with two datasets from kaggle which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews
